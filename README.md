# CaesarSolver
This repo holds a few tools for solving basic Caesar Ciphers and Vigenère Ciphers.

Run `make` in the main directory in order to create the command line programs.

You can then use the `caesar` and `vigenere` commands to help you solve Caesar Ciphers and Vigenère Ciphers, respectively.

In order to use these two tools in a program, take a look at the code and the comments in order to gain a better understanding of how it works.
